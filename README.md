# Macros
A repo of Macros that I've made/acquired over the years.

This includes Excel Macros (VBA), VBScripts, or anything else that speeds up work.

The plan is to copy these verbatim and then tweak and cut them down to basic user guide that can be understood by anyone. This will give anyone the knowledge I picked up in my first years of coding in an easily digestible format. From there I can build out this guide into a bit of an instruction manual. There will be a lot of different random macros to begin with - but they will disappear with time and anything that is duplicated will go.

I'm always up for suggestions, ideas, or recommendations - if you have any feel free to drop me a message on Twitter: (@caddickbrown)[https://twitter.com/caddickbrown]

# Different types of scripts.

## VBA Scripts
VBA scripts are scripts for Excel sheets. I tended to figure them out through recording actions and reviewing script in the VBA editor. I would then jigsaw things together. I would add a few things into every macro to speed things up and cut down on anything that wasn't needed in the script.

If ever I had an issue with script, I'd just step through it until I found the issue and fix it there.

## VBScripts
I used these to mimic keystrokes when I wasn't able to install key mimicking software. They don't need installation to run and can just be used by opening them.

# Future
May include Python in the future - but something I need to dabble in myself first.
