# Macros
A repo of Macros that I've made over the years.

This includes Excel Macros (VBA), VBScripts, or anything else that speeds up work.

VBScripts would mimic keystrokes and don't need anything installed to work. Was useful for when I couldn't install key mimicking software.

May include Python in the future - but something I need to dabble in myself first.
