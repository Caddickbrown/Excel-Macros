# Macros
A repo of Macros that I've made/acquired over the years.

This includes Excel Formulas, Excel Macros (VBA), VBScripts, or anything else that speeds up/automates work.

Before I start - and just to set the expectation - I'm aware of these working on Windows and this is what they were built for. However, I have no idea if they would/could work anywhere else. If someone is able to let me know, great - but otherwise I've no idea.

The plan is to copy these verbatim and then tweak and cut them down to basic user guide that can be understood by anyone. This will give anyone the knowledge I picked up in my first years of coding in an easily digestible format. From there I can build out this guide into a bit of an instruction manual. There will be a lot of different random macros to begin with - but they will disappear with time and anything that is duplicated will go.

I'm always up for suggestions, ideas, or recommendations - if you have any feel free to drop me a message on Twitter: [@caddickbrown](https://twitter.com/caddickbrown)

# Different types of scripts.

## Excel
Various Excel formulas that are of use, albeit perhaps a bit niche. They should be more complicated than a single formula, generally a combination used in a novel way.

## VBA
VBA scripts are scripts generally for Excel sheets, but also can be used in other Office Programs. I tended to figure them out through recording actions and reviewing script in the VBA editor. I would then jigsaw things together. I would add a few things into every macro to speed things up and cut down on anything that wasn't needed in the script.

If ever I had an issue with script, I'd just step through it until I found the issue and fix it there.

A user guide can be found here: [VBA Guide](https://github.com/Caddickbrown/Programming-Notes/blob/main/Guidebook/VBA.vba)

## VBScripts
Not to be confused with VBA as there are a lot of different syntaxes. Could be referred to as VBScripts, VBS Scripts, or VBS in this guide.

I started using these I wasn't able to install key mimicking software. They don't need installation to run and can just be used by opening them. There is _very basic_ UI functionality but nothing extensive. If you can automate a task down to simple sums and keystrokes, then this isn't a bad option. They can run in the background and can be put in the "Startup" folder to run after logging in for the first time.

# Future
May include Python in the future - but something I need to dabble in myself first.

# Rules
1. Nothing will go in here that I do not understand unless otherwise stated.
2. Do. Not. Talk. About. Fight. Club.
